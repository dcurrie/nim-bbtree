# BBTree

BBTree is a Bounded Balance Tree library for the [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org).

## BBTree Overview

BBTrees, also known as Weight Balanced Trees, or Adams Trees, are a persistent data structure
with a nice combination of properties:

* Generic (parameterized) key,value map
* Insert (`add`), lookup (`get`), and delete (`del`) in O(log(N)) time
* Key-ordered iterators (`inorder` and `revorder`)
* Lookup by relative position from beginning or end (`getNth`) in O(log(N)) time
* Efficient set operations TODO

By "persistent" we mean that the BBTree always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. 
As such it is effectively immutable, as the operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, 
but instead always yield a new updated structure.

The BBTree data structure resides in heap memory, and is destroyed by the garbage collector when there 
are no longer any program references to it. When insertions or deletions to the tree are made, we 
attempt to reuse as much of the old structure as possible.

Because the BBTree is never mutated all library functions that operate on it are Nim `func` -- no side effects.
A BBTree may be shared across threads safely (though updates in one thread will not be visible 
in another until the modified tree is shared once again).
